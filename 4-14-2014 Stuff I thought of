Things I Thought still need to be done:

-Show message box when user tries to split a note into something shorter than 16th note
-Show message box when user tries to combine note into something larger than 4th note



Things I did
-Commented
-Code to visually uncolor playhead for stop button
    -Found that play/pause button doesn't exactly work right. Once paused, clicking the stop button resumes the playhead.
    -Also, once paused, it will randomly start playing again (maybe on cursor move while hovered over play button)
